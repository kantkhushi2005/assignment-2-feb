    "    1. Artificial Intelligence\n",

    "Sure! Let’s break down each term with a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
    "**Definition:** AI is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider \"smart.\" It encompasses various techniques and approaches to enable machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa is an example of AI. It can understand spoken commands, process them, and respond with useful information or perform tasks, like setting reminders or playing music.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "**Definition:** ML is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on explicitly programmed rules, ML systems learn from data to improve their performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** An email spam filter is a good example of ML. It’s trained on a dataset of emails, some labeled as “spam” and others as “not spam.” Over time, the filter learns to recognize patterns and characteristics of spam emails, improving its ability to classify new emails correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Deep Learning\n",
    "**Definition:** Deep Learning is a subset of ML that involves neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\"). These networks can automatically learn to represent data with increasing levels of abstraction, which is particularly useful for tasks involving complex data like images, text, or speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Image recognition systems, such as those used in photo tagging on social media, often use deep learning. For instance, when you upload a photo and it automatically tags friends, it’s using a deep learning model to recognize faces and match them with known individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- **AI** is the broad goal of creating intelligent systems.\n",
    "- **ML** is a way to achieve AI by training models on data.\n",
    "- **Deep Learning** is a specialized approach within ML that uses complex neural networks to handle complex tasks.\n",
