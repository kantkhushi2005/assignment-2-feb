    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `Exception` class as the base class for creating custom exceptions in Python for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistency**: Inheriting from `Exception` ensures that your custom exception integrates seamlessly with Python's built-in exception handling mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Functionality**: By inheriting from `Exception`, your custom exception gains all the functionality of the base class, including methods like `__init__` and `__str__` for error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hierarchy**: It allows your custom exception to fit into Python's exception hierarchy, making it possible to catch it using generic `except` blocks or handle it specifically in more refined blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Custom Behavior**: You can extend or override the behavior of `Exception` to add specific functionalities or attributes relevant to your custom exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        super().__init__(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    raise CustomError(\"Something went wrong!\")\n",
    "except CustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)  # Output: Something went wrong!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `CustomError` inherits from `Exception`, allowing it to be used in a `try`-`except` block just like any built-in exception."

    "Q2. Write a python program to print Python Exception Hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To print the Python exception hierarchy, you can use the `inspect` module to explore and display the exception classes. Here's a short Python program that does this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import inspect\n",
    "import builtins\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_exception_hierarchy(exception_class, indent=0):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Recursively print the hierarchy of exceptions.\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(' ' * indent + exception_class.__name__)\n",
    "    for subclass in exception_class.__subclasses__():\n",
    "        print_exception_hierarchy(subclass, indent + 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the hierarchy starting from the base Exception class\n",
    "print_exception_hierarchy(builtins.BaseException)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `print_exception_hierarchy` is a recursive function that prints the class name of each exception and its subclasses.\n",
    "- It starts from `builtins.BaseException`, which is the root of the Python exception hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this program, it will print the hierarchy of Python exceptions, showing how exceptions are organized and inherited."

    "Q3. What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ArithmeticError` class in Python is a base class for errors related to arithmetic operations. It includes several built-in exception classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`ZeroDivisionError`**: Raised when dividing a number by zero.\n",
    "2. **`OverflowError`**: Raised when an operation exceeds the maximum limit for a numeric type.\n",
    "3. **`FloatingPointError`**: Raised for floating-point operations that fail.\n",
    "4. **`ValueError`**: (Not strictly an `ArithmeticError`, but often included in numeric operations) Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but inappropriate value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ZeroDivisionError**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")  # Output: Error: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **OverflowError**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = math.exp(1000)  # This will exceed the floating-point range\n",

    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")  # Output: Error: math range error\n",
    "```\n",

    "In these examples, `ZeroDivisionError` occurs due to division by zero, and `OverflowError` occurs because the exponential function exceeds the limits of floating-point numbers."

    "Q4. Why LookupError class is used? Explain with an example KeyError and IndexError.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LookupError` class in Python is a base class for exceptions raised when a lookup operation fails. It is inherited by two main exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`KeyError`**: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "2. **`IndexError`**: Raised when a sequence index is out of range.\n",

    "Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Catch Specific Exceptions**: Handle specific exceptions rather than using a broad `except` clause. This ensures you only catch the exceptions you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n",
    "        # handle specific exceptions\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoid Bare Except Clauses**: Do not use `except:` without specifying an exception. This can catch unexpected issues and make debugging harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code\n",
    "    except Exception as e:  # Better to use a specific exception\n",
    "        # handle the exception\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use `finally` for Cleanup**: Use the `finally` block to ensure resources are released regardless of whether an exception was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code that uses resources\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        # cleanup code\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Log Exceptions**: Log exceptions to track errors and debug issues. This helps in diagnosing problems later.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        logging.error(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Avoid Empty Exception Handlers**: Do not leave `except` blocks empty. Always handle the exception or re-raise it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        # handle or re-raise the exception\n",
    "        raise\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use Custom Exceptions**: Define and use custom exceptions to represent specific error conditions in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code\n",
    "    except CustomError as e:\n",
    "        # handle custom error\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Avoid Exception Handling for Control Flow**: Do not use exceptions for regular control flow; use them for actual error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Bad practice\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code that might raise an exception\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        # handle the exception\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**: Be specific in exception handling, log errors, use `finally` for cleanup, and avoid using exceptions for control flow."
