    "  - Regularization adds a penalty to the loss function based on the magnitude of the coefficients. This discourages overly complex models with large coefficients that can fit the training data too closely (overfitting).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **With Ridge Regularization**: The model’s coefficients are penalized, reducing their size and complexity. This prevents the model from fitting the noise in the training data and improves its performance on new, unseen data by keeping the model simpler and more generalizable.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Choice of Regularization Parameter**:\n",
    "   - The effectiveness of regularization depends on the choice of the regularization parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)). Selecting the optimal \\(\\lambda\\) often requires cross-validation and can be challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assumption of Linearity**:\n",
