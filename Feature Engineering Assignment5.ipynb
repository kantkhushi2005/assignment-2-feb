    "### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collect Data:** Assume we have data for 30 sales representatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Means:**\n",
    "   - Mean of sales calls per day (\\(\\bar{x}\\)).\n",
    "   - Mean of sales made per week (\\(\\bar{y}\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute Differences:**\n",
    "   - Calculate the difference from the mean for each value: \\((x_i - \\bar{x})\\) and \\((y_i - \\bar{y})\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Products:**\n",
    "   - Compute the product of these differences for each pair: \\((x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sum Products:**\n",
    "   - Sum these products.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Compute Squared Differences:**\n",
    "   - Sum the squared differences for both variables: \\(\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2\\) and \\(\\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2\\).\n",

    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient \\( r \\approx 0.984 \\) indicates a very strong positive linear relationship between the number of sales calls made per day and the number of sales made per week in this sample dataset. This means that as the number of sales calls increases, the number of sales made also tends to increase significantly."
