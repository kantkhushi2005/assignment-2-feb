    "Q1. What is the main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance\n",
    "metric in KNN? How might this difference affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Difference**:\n",
    "- **Euclidean Distance**: Measures the straight-line distance between two points in multidimensional space. It is computed using the square root of the sum of the squared differences.\n",
    "- **Manhattan Distance**: Measures the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences along each dimension (grid-like path).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect on Performance**:\n",
    "- **Euclidean Distance**: \n",
    "  - **Sensitivity**: Sensitive to the magnitude of differences in feature values. Works well when the data follows a natural straight-line distance relationship.\n",
    "  - **Performance**: May be less effective if features have vastly different scales or if the data is grid-like.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manhattan Distance**: \n",
    "  - **Sensitivity**: Less sensitive to the magnitude of differences; better for grid-like or high-dimensional data where differences are more discrete.\n",
    "  - **Performance**: Can perform better in cases where features are on different scales or when data points align more naturally along axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**:\n",
    "The choice between Euclidean and Manhattan distance affects how distances are computed and can influence the accuracy of KNN. Euclidean distance is typically preferred for continuous and naturally metric data, while Manhattan distance may be better for discrete or grid-like data."

    "Choosing the optimal value of \\( k \\) for a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier or regressor involves balancing bias and variance. Here are key techniques to determine the optimal \\( k \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Cross-Validation**\n",
    "   - **Method**: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance for different \\( k \\) values. Select the \\( k \\) that yields the best performance (e.g., highest accuracy for classifiers, lowest error for regressors) on the validation set.\n",

    "### Potential Drawbacks of KNN\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computationally Expensive**:\n",
    "   - **Drawback**: KNN can be slow, especially with large datasets, because it requires calculating distances to all training points for each prediction.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **High Memory Usage**:\n",

    "3. **Curse of Dimensionality**:\n",
    "   - **Drawback**: Performance degrades as the number of features increases, making distances less informative.\n",
    "   - **Solution**: Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or feature selection to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sensitive to Noise and Outliers**:\n",
    "   - **Drawback**: Outliers or noisy data points can adversely affect the predictions.\n",

    "5. **Feature Scaling Issues**:\n",
    "   - **Drawback**: KNN is sensitive to the scale of features, which can affect distance calculations.\n",

    "\n",
    "6. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**:\n",
