    "\n",
    "### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**:\n",
    "- **DBSCAN** is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together points that are close to each other based on a distance metric and a minimum number of points required to form a dense region.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**:\n",
    "1. **Parameters**:\n",
    "   - **`eps`**: The maximum distance between two points for them to be considered neighbors.\n",
    "   - **`min_samples`**: The minimum number of points required to form a dense region (core point).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clustering Process**:\n",
    "   - **Core Points**: Points with at least `min_samples` neighbors within a distance `eps`.\n",
    "   - **Border Points**: Points that are within `eps` distance of a core point but do not have enough neighbors themselves.\n",
    "   - **Noise Points**: Points that are neither core nor border points and are considered outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Algorithm Steps**:\n",
    "   - **Initialization**: Start with an unvisited point.\n",
    "   - **Neighborhood Search**: Find all points within `eps` distance.\n",
    "   - **Cluster Formation**: If the point is a core point, form a cluster with its neighbors and recursively expand the cluster.\n",
    "   - **Noise Handling**: Points that do not fit into any cluster are marked as noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
