    "Q.1) A tuple is a data structure in Python that is similar to a list but with some key differences. Here are the characteristics of tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered: Like lists, tuples are ordered collections of elements. The order in which elements are inserted is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous: Tuples can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, floats, strings, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable: One of the main characteristics of tuples is that they are immutable. Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its contents - you cannot add, remove, or modify elements. However, you can create a new tuple with the desired changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexed: Elements in a tuple are accessed using indices, similar to lists. The indexing starts from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative: You can iterate over the elements of a tuple using a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of creating and using a tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, \"hello\", 3.14)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "for item in my_tuple:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "    \n",
    "So, to answer your question: Yes, tuples are immutable in Python. Once you create a tuple, you cannot change its elements directly. If you need a similar data structure that allows modifications, you might use a list instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"

    "Q.2) In Python, tuples have two built-in methods: count() and index().\n",
    "\n",
    "1. count() Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method returns the number of occurrences of a specified value in the tuple.\n",
    "Syntax: tuple.count(value)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5)\n",
    "count_of_2 = my_tuple.count(2)\n",
    "print(count_of_2)  # Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "2. index() Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in the tuple.\n",
    "Syntax: tuple.index(value, start, end)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "index_of_3 = my_tuple.index(3)\n",
    "print(index_of_3)  # Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as for why tuples have only these two built-in methods compared to lists, it's mainly due to the immutability of tuples. Since tuples cannot be modified after creation, there's less need for methods that involve altering the contents of the tuple. Lists, being mutable, have more methods like append(), extend(), remove(), and others that allow for in-place modifications. The simplicity of tuples, with fewer methods, aligns with their intended use cases where immutability is a desired property. This design choice makes tuples more lightweight and efficient for certain scenarios, such as when you need a fixed collection of items that should not be changed."

    "Q.3) In Python, the collection datatype that does not allow duplicate items is the set. Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. You can use a set to efficiently remove duplicates from a list. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 4]\n",

    "Q.4) In Python, both the union() and update() methods are used with sets, but they serve slightly different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. union() Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The union() method returns a new set containing all the unique elements from the sets involved in the operation. It does not modify the original sets.\n",

    "\n",
    "The update() method modifies the set it is called on by adding elements from another set (or iterable) to it. It performs an in-place addition.\n",
    "Syntax: set.update(set1)\n",
    "EXAMPLE:\n",

    "set1.update(set2)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(set1)  \n",
    "print(set2) \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the key difference is that union() returns a new set without modifying the original sets, while update() modifies the set it is called on by adding elements from another set. Depending on your use case, you may choose one method over the other. If you want to preserve the original sets, use union(). If you don't need the original sets and want to modify one of them in-place, use update().\n",

    "Q.5) A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key must be unique. It is a mutable and versatile data structure that allows you to store and retrieve values based on keys.
