    "Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. It builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of these trees. This approach improves accuracy and helps prevent overfitting by averaging out the errors of individual trees. Essentially, it's a collection of decision trees working together to make more robust and reliable predictions."

    "Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor reduces overfitting by averaging the predictions of multiple decision trees, which helps to smooth out the errors of individual trees. Additionally, it introduces randomness in the tree-building process (e.g., by using different subsets of data and features for each tree), which prevents any single tree from dominating and helps generalize better to unseen data."

    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Reduced Overfitting**: By averaging multiple trees, it reduces the risk of overfitting compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "2. **High Accuracy**: Often provides better accuracy and robustness in predictions.\n",
    "3. **Handles Missing Data**: Can handle missing values well by averaging predictions from multiple trees.\n",
    "4. **Feature Importance**: Can provide insights into feature importance, helping in understanding the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. **Complexity**: Can be computationally intensive and less interpretable due to the ensemble of many trees.\n",
    "2. **Slower Prediction**: May be slower for predictions compared to a single decision tree, especially with a large number of trees.\n",
    "3. **Memory Usage**: Requires more memory to store the multiple trees compared to a single tree model."
