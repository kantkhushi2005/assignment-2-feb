    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ridge Regression**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Ridge regression is a type of regularized linear regression that adds a penalty to the loss function based on the squared values of the coefficients, known as L2 regularization. It helps handle multicollinearity and prevents overfitting by shrinking the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Equation**:\n",
    "  \\[ \\text{Loss} = \\text{MSE} + \\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^n \\beta_i^2 \\]\n",
    "  where \\( \\lambda \\) is the regularization parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regularization**:\n",
    "   - **Ridge Regression**: Includes an additional penalty term \\( \\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^n \\beta_i^2 \\) in the loss function.\n",
    "   - **OLS Regression**: Minimizes only the mean squared error without any penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coefficient Shrinkage**:\n",
    "   - **Ridge Regression**: Shrinks the coefficients, reducing their magnitude and addressing multicollinearity.\n",
    "   - **OLS Regression**: Estimates coefficients directly without regularization, which can lead to overfitting in the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling Multicollinearity**:\n",
    "   - **Ridge Regression**: Effective in dealing with multicollinearity by penalizing large coefficients.\n",
    "   - **OLS Regression**: May produce unstable estimates if predictors are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**:\n",
    "Ridge regression improves on OLS by adding a penalty term that shrinks coefficients, helping to manage multicollinearity and reduce overfitting."

    "2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n",
    "4. **Normality of Errors**: The residuals (errors) are normally distributed, especially for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to test different values of λ. Choose the λ that minimizes the cross-validated error, typically Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Grid Search**: Systematically search through a range of λ values to identify the best one based on cross-validation performance.\n",

    "- **Ridge Regression**: Generally **does not** perform feature selection because it shrinks coefficients but does not set them to zero. All features remain in the model, albeit with smaller coefficients.\n",

    "Ridge regression does not inherently perform feature selection. For feature selection, Lasso regression or other techniques that explicitly shrink some coefficients to zero are more appropriate."
