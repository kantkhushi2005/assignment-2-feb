    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiprocessing in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Multiprocessing in Python involves running multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. It allows for parallel execution of tasks, leveraging multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Itâ€™s Useful**:\n",
    "1. **Parallelism**: It enables parallel execution of tasks, improving performance and speed, especially for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "2. **Avoiding GIL**: Unlike threading, multiprocessing bypasses Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), allowing true parallel execution of Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module**: The `multiprocessing` module in Python is used to create and manage multiple processes."

    "Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences Between Multiprocessing and Multithreading:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concurrency vs. Parallelism**:\n",
    "   - **Multithreading**: Achieves concurrency (overlapping of tasks) within a single process, using multiple threads that share the same memory space.\n",
    "   - **Multiprocessing**: Achieves parallelism (simultaneous execution) by running separate processes with their own memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**:\n",
    "   - **Multithreading**: Constrained by Python's GIL, which allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time in a single process.\n",
    "   - **Multiprocessing**: Bypasses the GIL as each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Usage**:\n",
    "   - **Multithreading**: Threads share the same memory space, which can lead to easier data sharing but also potential for data corruption if not handled properly.\n",
    "   - **Multiprocessing**: Processes have separate memory spaces, avoiding data corruption but requiring inter-process communication (IPC) for data sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Overhead**:\n",
    "   - **Multithreading**: Generally has lower overhead compared to multiprocessing due to shared memory.\n",
    "   - **Multiprocessing**: Has higher overhead due to separate memory space and the need for IPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use Cases**:\n",
    "   - **Multithreading**: Suitable for I/O-bound tasks and applications where tasks need to be performed concurrently.\n",
    "   - **Multiprocessing**: Suitable for CPU-bound tasks where tasks can benefit from parallel execution on multiple cores."

    "Q3. Write a python code to create a process using the multiprocessing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple Python code snippet that demonstrates how to create a process using the `multiprocessing` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function to be executed in the new process\n",
    "def print_numbers():\n",
    "    for i in range(5):\n",
    "        print(f\"Number: {i}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new process\n",
    "process = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_numbers)\n",

    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**: `print_numbers` function will be executed by the new process.\n",
    "2. **Process Creation**: `multiprocessing.Process` is used to create a new process with `print_numbers` as the target function.\n",
    "3. **Start**: `process.start()` starts the execution of the new process.\n",
    "4. **Join**: `process.join()` waits for the process to complete before continuing."

    "Q4. What is a multiprocessing pool in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **multiprocessing pool** in Python is a mechanism provided by the `multiprocessing` module that allows you to manage a pool of worker processes for parallel execution of tasks. It's used to simplify the parallel execution of a function across multiple input values and can be more efficient than manually creating and managing individual processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To distribute tasks across multiple processes, making parallel execution of functions easier and more efficient.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Ideal for scenarios where you need to apply a function to many pieces of data independently, such as in data processing or computational tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a pool of 4 worker processes\n",
    "with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4) as pool:\n",
    "    # Map the function 'square' to a list of numbers\n",
    "    results = pool.map(square, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(results)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Pool` object is used to parallelize the application of the `square` function across the list of numbers. The `map` method distributes these tasks across the pool of worker processes."

    "\n",
    "1. **Import the `multiprocessing` module**.\n",
