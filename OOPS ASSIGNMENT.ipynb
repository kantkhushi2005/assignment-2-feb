    "Q.2) The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: This refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal details of how an object operates and exposing only what is necessary. It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of an existing class (base class or superclass). This promotes code reuse, as the subclass can reuse the attributes and methods of the superclass and can also provide its own additional features or modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential features they share. It allows the programmer to focus on the relevant details of an object and ignore irrelevant details. Abstraction is implemented through abstract classes and interfaces, where the essential characteristics of an object are defined, but specific implementations are left to the subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It allows a single interface to represent different types of objects and enables code to work with objects of various types in a unified manner. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) and method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars provide a foundation for designing and implementing object-oriented systems, promoting principles such as modularity, flexibility, and reusability in software development."

    "Q.4) In object-oriented programming (OOP), self is a convention used to represent the instance of the class. It is the first parameter in the method definition within a class, and it refers to the instance on which the method is called. The use of self is crucial for several reasons:\n",
