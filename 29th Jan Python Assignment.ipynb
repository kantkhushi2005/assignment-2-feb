    "Q-1 Who developed Python Programming Language? \n",
    "Python was developed by Guido van Rossum. He started working on Python in the late 1980s, and the first version, Python 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. Guido van Rossum continued to lead the development of Python for many years and was widely recognized as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) until he stepped down from that role in July 2018."

    "Q-2 Which type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "Python is a versatile programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Procedural Programming**: Writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data.\n",
    "2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Encapsulating data and functions that operate on the data into objects and classes.\n",
    "3. **Functional Programming**: Treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoiding changing-state and mutable data.\n",
    "4. **Imperative Programming**: Using statements that change a program's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Python supports:\n",
    "- **Event-Driven Programming**: Responding to events such as user actions (mouse clicks, keyboard inputs).\n",
    "- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Separating cross-cutting concerns from business logic.\n",
    "- **Metaprogramming**: Writing programs that can manipulate themselves or other programs.\n",

    "Q-14 How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory management in Python is handled automatically through several mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic Garbage Collection**: Python uses a garbage collector to automatically manage memory. The garbage collector keeps track of objects and deallocates memory when objects are no longer in use. This process helps in freeing up memory and avoiding memory leaks. Python uses a technique called reference counting along with a cyclic garbage collector to handle circular references.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reference Counting**: Each object in Python has a reference count, which keeps track of how many references exist to that object. When the reference count drops to zero (meaning no references to the object exist), the object’s memory is deallocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cyclic Garbage Collection**: In addition to reference counting, Python employs a cyclic garbage collector to handle reference cycles (situations where two or more objects reference each other, creating a cycle). The cyclic garbage collector periodically checks for and collects these cycles to free up memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory Pools**: Python uses a memory management technique called memory pooling to reduce overhead and improve performance. For small objects, Python uses a system of memory pools to manage memory allocation and deallocation efficiently. This approach minimizes fragmentation and overhead associated with frequent memory allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dynamic Typing**: Python’s dynamic typing allows for flexible memory management as it can handle various data types and structures. This flexibility comes with its own set of trade-offs in terms of performance, but it simplifies memory management for the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Object Interning**: For some immutable objects (like small integers and strings), Python uses a technique called interning to reuse existing objects rather than creating new ones. This reduces memory consumption and speeds up comparisons for these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Memory Management in C Extensions**: When using C extensions or interfacing with C code, memory management can be more manual. In such cases, developers need to be careful to manage memory explicitly and avoid leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Python’s memory management aims to balance performance, ease of use, and resource efficiency by automating most of the memory handling tasks.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step guide on how to install Python on Windows and set the path variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download the Installer**:\n",
    "   - Go to the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n",
    "   - Navigate to the Downloads section and click on \"Download Python\" to get the latest stable version for Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Installer**:\n",
    "   - Locate the downloaded installer file (usually in your Downloads folder) and double-click it to start the installation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customize Installation**:\n",
    "   - Check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH\" at the bottom of the installer window. This ensures that Python is added to your system's PATH variable.\n",
    "   - Click on \"Customize installation\" to choose optional features and installation location. It's recommended to leave the default settings unless you have specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Install**:\n",
    "   - Click \"Install Now\" to proceed with the installation. The installer will install Python and the necessary tools and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verifying the Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open Command Prompt**:\n",
    "   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter to open the Command Prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check Python Version**:\n",
    "   - Type `python --version` or `python -V` and press Enter. You should see the version number of the installed Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Pip Version**:\n",
    "   - Type `pip --version` and press Enter to verify that Pip, the Python package installer, is also installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Path Variables Manually (if needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open System Properties**:\n",
    "   - Right-click on the Start button and select \"System\".\n",
    "   - Click on \"Advanced system settings\" on the left.\n",
    "   - In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edit the Path Variable**:\n",
    "   - In the Environment Variables window, find the \"Path\" variable under the \"System variables\" section and select it.\n",
    "   - Click the \"Edit\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add Python Paths**:\n",
    "   - In the Edit Environment Variable window, click \"New\" and add the path to the Python installation directory. For example, `C:\\Python39` (this may vary based on your installation).\n",
    "   - Also, add the path to the `Scripts` directory within the Python installation directory. For example, `C:\\Python39\\Scripts`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Save and Apply**:\n",
    "   - Click \"OK\" to close the Edit Environment Variable window.\n",
    "   - Click \"OK\" to close the Environment Variables window.\n",
    "   - Click \"OK\" to close the System Properties window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verifying Path Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open a New Command Prompt**:\n",
    "   - Open a new Command Prompt window to apply the changes made to the Path variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check Python and Pip**:\n",
    "   - Type `python --version` and `pip --version` to confirm that both commands are recognized and return the correct version information.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you should have Python installed on your Windows system with the Path variables properly configured. This allows you to run Python and Pip commands from any command prompt window."
