    "### Limitations of Using Accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Imbalance**:\n",
    "   - **Issue**: Accuracy can be misleading in datasets with imbalanced classes, where the majority class dominates.\n",
    "   - **Solution**: Use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or the ROC-AUC score that better reflect performance across different classes.\n",

    "   - **Issue**: Accuracy does not distinguish between different types of classification errors (e.g., false positives vs. false negatives).\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Ignoring Class-Specific Performance**:\n",
    "   - **Issue**: Accuracy treats all classes equally, which may not be ideal if some classes are more important.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **No Measure of Confidence**:\n",
    "   - **Issue**: Accuracy does not convey how confident the model is in its predictions.\n",
