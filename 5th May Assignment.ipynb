    "Q1. What is meant by time-dependent seasonal components?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time-dependent seasonal components** refer to seasonal patterns in time series data that vary over time. Unlike fixed seasonal effects, these components can change in magnitude, frequency, or duration, making them dynamic rather than constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Variation Over Time**: The seasonal pattern itself evolves or changes over different periods.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Seasonality**: Examples include shifting holiday sales patterns or changing weather effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "A retail store might experience varying seasonal sales patterns each year due to changing consumer behavior or promotional strategies, making the seasonal component time-dependent."

    "\n",
    "3. **Order Selection**:\n",
