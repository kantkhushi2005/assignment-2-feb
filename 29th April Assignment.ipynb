    "### Basic Concept of Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clustering** is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points into clusters. The goal is to partition the dataset into distinct groups where points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to points in other clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customer Segmentation**:\n",
    "   - **Use**: Group customers based on purchasing behavior for targeted marketing and personalized offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Image Segmentation**:\n",
    "   - **Use**: Partition images into regions or objects for better image analysis and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Anomaly Detection**:\n",
    "   - **Use**: Identify unusual patterns or outliers in data, such as fraud detection in financial transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Document Clustering**:\n",
    "   - **Use**: Organize large text corpora into topics or categories for improved information retrieval.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts**:\n",
    "- **Core Points**: Points with at least a minimum number of neighbors within a given radius (epsilon).\n",

    "3. **DBSCAN**:\n",
    "   - **Approach**: Groups points based on density, can find arbitrarily shaped clusters, and does not require specifying the number of clusters.\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: Handles noise well, does not assume cluster shape, and can discover clusters of varying shapes and sizes.\n",
