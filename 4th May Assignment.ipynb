    "### ARIMA Modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ARIMA** stands for **AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average**. It is a popular method for time series forecasting that models data based on its own past values and errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Components:**\n",
    "1. **AutoRegressive (AR)**: Models the current value as a function of previous values.\n",
    "2. **Integrated (I)**: Involves differencing the series to make it stationary.\n",
    "3. **Moving Average (MA)**: Models the current value as a function of past forecast errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Use ARIMA for Forecasting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stationarity Check**:\n",
    "   - Ensure the time series is stationary (constant mean and variance) by applying tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Differencing**:\n",
    "   - Apply differencing to make the series stationary if needed. This involves subtracting the previous observation from the current observation.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **White Noise Residuals**:\n",
    "   - **Assumption**: Residuals (errors) from the model should be white noise—i.e., uncorrelated and normally distributed with constant variance.\n",
    "   - **Testing**: Plot residuals and perform statistical tests like the Ljung-Box test to check for autocorrelation. Use Q-Q plots or statistical tests to check for normality.\n",

    "   - **Limitation**: Many time series models assume stationarity, which may not hold in practice. Non-stationary data can lead to inaccurate forecasts.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Sensitivity to Outliers**:\n",
    "   - **Limitation**: Time series models can be sensitive to outliers or anomalies, which can distort the results.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Model Complexity and Overfitting**:\n",
    "   - **Limitation**: Complex models with many parameters can overfit the training data and perform poorly on new data.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Seasonal and Cyclical Patterns**:\n",
    "   - **Limitation**: Standard time series models may not capture long-term cyclical patterns or irregular seasonality.\n",
