    "### Exception in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When Python encounters an error that it cannot handle, it raises an exception, which can then be caught and handled using a `try-except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference Between Exception and Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exception:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** An error that occurs during the execution of a program.\n",
    "   - **When it occurs:** At runtime.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Division by zero, file not found, etc.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** Can be handled using `try-except` blocks.\n",
    "   - **Code Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         1 / 0\n",
    "     except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "         print(\"Caught an exception:\", e)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Syntax Error:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** An error in the syntax of the code, making it invalid Python code.\n",
    "   - **When it occurs:** At compile time, before the program starts running.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Missing colon, incorrect indentation, etc.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** Must be corrected by the programmer before the code can run.\n",
    "   - **Code Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     if True\n",
    "         print(\"This will cause a syntax error\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **Exceptions** occur at runtime and can be caught and handled in the program.\n",
    "- **Syntax Errors** occur at compile time and must be fixed before running the program."

    "Q-2 What happen when an exception is not handled?Explain with an example\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled in Python, the program terminates abruptly, and an error message (traceback) is displayed, indicating the type of exception and the location in the code where the exception occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "print(divide(10, 0))\n",
    "print(\"This line will not be executed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `divide` function attempts to divide `10` by `0`, which raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "- Since there is no `try-except` block to handle the exception, the program terminates, and the traceback is displayed.\n",
    "- The line `print(\"This line will not be executed.\")` is not executed because the program stops at the point where the exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 5, in <module>\n",
    "    print(divide(10, 0))\n",

    "Q5. What are Custom Exceptions in Python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Exceptions** in Python are user-defined exception classes that allow you to create specific error types relevant to your application. They enable you to provide more meaningful and specific error messages compared to built-in exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Custom Exceptions?**\n",
    "1. **Clarity**: Makes error handling more descriptive and meaningful.\n",
    "2. **Control**: Allows you to handle specific types of errors more precisely.\n",
    "3. **Maintainability**: Makes your code easier to understand and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",

    "class NegativeAgeError(Exception):\n",
