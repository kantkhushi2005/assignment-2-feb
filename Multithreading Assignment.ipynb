    "**Multithreading in Python**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is a technique where multiple threads execute concurrently within a single process. Threads are lighter than processes and share the same memory space, allowing for efficient data sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Is Used**:\n",
    "- **Concurrency**: To run multiple tasks simultaneously, improving efficiency.\n",
    "- **Responsiveness**: To keep programs responsive, such as in GUIs or web servers.\n",
    "- **I/O-bound Tasks**: To handle tasks that are waiting for external resources (like file I/O or network operations) without blocking the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module Used**:\n",
    "- The `threading` module is used to handle threads in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_numbers():\n",
    "    for i in range(5):\n",
    "        print(i)\n",

    "def print_letters():\n",

    "\n",
    "**Functions in the `threading` Module**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`activeCount()`**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Returns the number of Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "   - **Use**: To check how many threads are currently active in the program.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",

    "     print(threading.activeCount())\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",

    "     print(threading.currentThread())\n",

    " **Threading Functions in Python**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`run()`**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Contains the code that is executed when the thread starts.\n",
    "   - **Use**: You typically override this method in a subclass of `Thread` to define what the thread should do.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import threading\n",

    "2. **`start()`**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Starts a thread's activity. It invokes the `run()` method in a separate thread of control.\n",
    "   - **Use**: You call this method to begin the execution of the thread.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **`join()`**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Blocks the calling thread until the thread whose `join()` method is called terminates.\n",
    "   - **Use**: To wait for a thread to complete its execution before proceeding.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",

    "4. **`isAlive()`**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Returns `True` if the thread is still alive (i.e., it has been started and has not yet finished execution).\n",

    "   - **Example**:\n",

    "Q5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Performance**: Multithreading can lead to faster execution by allowing multiple threads to run concurrently on multi-core processors.\n",
    "2. **Responsiveness**: It enhances the responsiveness of applications, especially in user interfaces, where background tasks can run simultaneously with the main application.\n",
    "3. **Resource Sharing**: Threads within the same process share resources like memory, which can lead to efficient resource utilization compared to processes.\n",
    "4. **Parallelism**: Multithreading enables parallel execution of tasks, making better use of multi-core CPUs and improving overall throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complexity**: Managing multiple threads increases the complexity of the code, which can lead to challenging debugging and maintenance.\n",
    "2. **Synchronization Issues**: Threads may need synchronization to avoid issues like race conditions, deadlocks, and data corruption, adding to the complexity.\n",
    "3. **Overhead**: Context switching between threads can introduce overhead, reducing the performance gains if not managed properly.\n",
    "4. **Concurrency Bugs**: Bugs related to concurrency, such as deadlocks and livelocks, can be difficult to identify and fix.\n",

    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deadlocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are each waiting for the other to release a resource, leading to a situation where none of the threads can proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Consider two threads, A and B. Thread A holds resource X and waits for resource Y, while Thread B holds resource Y and waits for resource X. Both threads end up waiting indefinitely, resulting in a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prevention**: Deadlocks can be prevented using techniques such as resource ordering, deadlock detection, and avoiding circular waits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Race Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: A race condition happens when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of uncontrollable events, like the order of thread execution. It leads to unpredictable results when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently without proper synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Two threads increment a shared counter. If both threads read the counter’s value at the same time, they might both increment it from the same initial value, leading to incorrect final results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prevention**: Race conditions can be mitigated using synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes, locks, or semaphores to ensure that only one thread accesses the critical section of code at a time."
