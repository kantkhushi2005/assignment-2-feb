    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elastic Net Regression**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Elastic Net Regression combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. It applies both penalties to the loss function, which helps balance feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Equation**:\n",
    "  \\[ \\text{Loss} = \\text{MSE} + \\lambda_1 \\sum_{i=1}^n |\\beta_i| + \\lambda_2 \\sum_{i=1}^n \\beta_i^2 \\]\n",
    "  where \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\) are the regularization parameters for L1 and L2 penalties, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences from Other Regression Techniques**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regularization**:\n",
    "   - **Elastic Net**: Uses a combination of L1 and L2 regularization, allowing for both feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.\n",
    "   - **Lasso Regression**: Uses only L1 regularization, focusing on feature selection.\n",
    "   - **Ridge Regression**: Uses only L2 regularization, focusing on coefficient shrinkage without feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Multicollinearity**:\n",
    "   - **Elastic Net**: Effectively handles multicollinearity by using L2 regularization alongside L1, which can help when predictors are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**:\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression integrates L1 and L2 regularization, combining feature selection with coefficient shrinkage, and is particularly useful for handling multicollinearity and when predictors are correlated."

    "\n",
    "**Choosing Optimal Regularization Parameters for Elastic Net Regression**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to evaluate different combinations of the regularization parameters \\(\\lambda_1\\) (L1) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) (L2). Select the combination that minimizes the cross-validated error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Grid Search**: Systematically search through a range of values for \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) to identify the best-performing pair based on cross-validation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Random Search**: Explore random combinations of \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) values, which can be more efficient than a full grid search.\n",

    "**Summary**:\n",
    "Optimal values for \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) are chosen through cross-validation, grid search, or random search to minimize prediction error and balance regularization effects."

    "Q3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Elastic Net Regression**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Combines L1 and L2 Regularization**: Balances feature selection (L1) and coefficient shrinkage (L2), offering more flexibility in handling both sparse and correlated predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handles Multicollinearity**: Effectively manages multicollinearity by including both regularization types, which can stabilize coefficient estimates in the presence of highly correlated predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Robust to Overfitting**: Reduces overfitting by controlling model complexity through both L1 and L2 penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complexity in Tuning**: Requires tuning two parameters (\\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\)), which can be more complex and computationally intensive compared to techniques with a single regularization parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Interpretability**: While it performs feature selection, the combined regularization might make it harder to interpret the impact of individual predictors compared to Lasso.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**:\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression provides a balance between feature selection and coefficient shrinkage, effectively handling multicollinearity, but requires careful tuning of two parameters and may complicate model interpretation."

    "1. **High-Dimensional Data**: When dealing with datasets where the number of features is much larger than the number of observations, such as in genomics or text analysis.\n",

    "2. **Multicollinearity**: When predictors are highly correlated, Elastic Net helps stabilize coefficient estimates by combining L1 and L2 regularization.\n",

    "3. **Feature Selection and Shrinkage**: When both feature selection and coefficient shrinkage are desired, such as in financial modeling or when building interpretable models with a large number of predictors.\n",

    "- **Non-Zero Coefficients**: Coefficients that are non-zero indicate predictors that have a significant impact on the outcome. The magnitude of these coefficients reflects the strength of their relationship with the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zero Coefficients**: Coefficients set to zero indicate predictors that have been excluded from the model due to their lack of significant contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Balance of Effects**: Elastic Net combines L1 and L2 regularization, so coefficients may be smaller compared to ordinary least squares but not necessarily zero. Coefficients reflect both feature selection (L1) and shrinkage (L2) effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**:\n",
    "In Elastic Net Regression, non-zero coefficients show significant predictors, while zero coefficients are excluded. Coefficients are generally smaller due to combined L1 and L2 regularization, reflecting a balance between feature selection and shrinkage."

    "\n",
    "2. **Model-Specific Methods**: Use algorithms or tools that can handle missing values directly if available. However, most Elastic Net implementations require a complete dataset.\n",
