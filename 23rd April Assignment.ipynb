    "\n",
    "### Curse of Dimensionality and Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: As the number of dimensions increases, the model may become overly complex and fit noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. This is because, with more features, the model has more capacity to learn intricate details, which can lead to poor generalization on new data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Underfitting**: In high-dimensional spaces, the data can become sparse, making it difficult for the model to find meaningful patterns even if it is simple. This sparsity can lead to underfitting, where the model fails to capture important relationships in the data because it cannot effectively utilize the available features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **Overfitting** occurs when high dimensionality allows the model to learn noise, leading to poor generalization.\n",

    "3. **Scree Plot**:\n",
    "   - **Method**: Plot the explained variance or singular values of each component. Look for the \"elbow\" point where adding more dimensions yields diminishing returns.\n",
