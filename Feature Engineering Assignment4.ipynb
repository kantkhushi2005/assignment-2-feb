    "\n",
    "Data encoding is the process of converting categorical or non-numeric data into a numeric format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. This is crucial because most algorithms require numerical input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Methods:**\n",
    "1. **One-Hot Encoding:** Creates binary columns for each category.\n",
    "2. **Label Encoding:** Assigns a unique integer to each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usefulness in Data Science:**\n",
    "- **Algorithm Compatibility:** Enables algorithms to process categorical data.\n",
    "- **Model Performance:** Helps in accurately capturing patterns and relationships in the data.\n",

    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding in situations where:\n",

    "1. **Few Categories:** The categorical feature has a small number of distinct categories.\n",
    "2. **Memory Efficiency:** You want to avoid increasing the dimensionality of the dataset significantly.\n",

    "Q4. Suppose you have a dataset containing categorical data with 5 unique values. Which encoding technique would you use to transform this data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms?\n",
    "Explain why you made this choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a dataset with categorical data containing 5 unique values, **one-hot encoding** is generally preferred. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Implicit Order:** One-hot encoding is useful when the categorical feature does not have an inherent order or ranking. It avoids imposing any ordinal relationship between categories, which can be a drawback with nominal encoding where integer values might suggest an ordinal relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoids Misinterpretation:** One-hot encoding ensures that the machine learning model does not misinterpret the integer-encoded categories as having a quantitative relationship. Each category is represented as a separate binary column, with the presence of a category indicated by a 1 and absence by a 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improves Model Performance:** Many machine learning algorithms, especially those that rely on distance metrics (e.g., k-nearest neighbors) or linear relationships (e.g., logistic regression), perform better when categorical data is one-hot encoded because it prevents the model from mistakenly assuming a numeric order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature:** \"Color\" with categories [\"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\", \"Yellow\", \"Purple\"].\n",

    "- Green: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n",
    "- Yellow: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n",
    "- Purple: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n",
